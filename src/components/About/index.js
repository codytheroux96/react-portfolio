				<p>
				Software developer who is passionate about tech and eager to always expand my knowledge and skills. I got into web development to make other people's lives easier and to work with a company that matches my values of how I believe people should be treated and is reflected in how they treat their clients/customers. Iâ€™m excited to use my talents of strong interpersonal communication paired with my ability to adapt quickly alongside my skills in web development to become a part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better experiences for a growing world.
